# Nanocellulose Enhanced Fish Gel


## Problem Statement
Asian Carps are invasive species in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River systems, and they have become a threat to native fishes, creating many serious ecological problem. We should find a way to increase the usability of Asian Carps as food resourses. Making Surimi food is a great solution. Surimi, a kind of protein-rich food made by fish mince, is gaining popularity in the U.S and Europe, and already very popular in Asian countries.

Most surimi gel is made by fresh fish because the frozen-stored process will degrade the proteins that impact the cross-linking property. In general, surimi gels made from frozen stored fishes tend to have decreased water holding capacity and poor gel texture and strength. However, using fresh fish will increase the cost of surimi prduction.

Surimi gel we made  
  
Finding innovative ways to produce high-quality surimi from frozen-stored Asian carps will use an under-utilized food source to create high-value products and provide a strong economic incentive to reduce these invasive species and lessen their detrimental environmental, ecological impacts on the great lakes and Mississippi River systems.  
There is a methods to increase the protein's cross-linking ability: Nanocellulose (NC). NC is a good gel enhancer that makes network into proteins to help cross-link and increase the water holding capacity. NC also has some health benefits like improving bowel movement, promoting healthy microbiota in digestive tract, and trapping heavy metals out of harm’s way.

We should find whether the NC enhnced gel has better gel quality and the relationship between the dosage of NC and gel quality.  

## Data Description
I make some gel samples with different NC dasage: no NC, 0.1% NC， 0.5% NC, and 1.0% NC. Then we need to collect data to compare their gel quality.  
Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) test is useful to measure the gel properties like hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness, resilience, and gel strength. To determine the gel quality of our samples, we will focus on hardness and gel strength, but other properties can help us find the relationship between NC dasage and gel properties.  
The data I use to analyze is measured on November 12th 2021 by TPA machine in Food Science Building. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/JingyiY99/JingyiProject/blob/master/assets/Result_11.12.csv" download>here</a>.
