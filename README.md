# Nanocellulose Enhanced Fish Gel


## Problem Statement
Asian Carps are invasive species in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River systems, and they have become a threat to native fishes, creating many serious ecological problem. We should find a way to increase the usability of Asian Carps as food resourses. Making Surimi food is a great solution. Surimi, a kind of protein-rich food made by fish mince, is gaining popularity in the U.S and Europe, and already very popular in Asian countries.

Most surimi gel is made by fresh fish because the frozen-stored process will degrade the proteins that impact the cross-linking property. In general, surimi gels made from frozen stored fishes tend to have decreased water holding capacity and poor gel texture and strength. However, using fresh fish will increase the cost of surimi prduction.

Finding innovative ways to produce high-quality surimi from frozen-stored Asian carps will use an under-utilized food source to create high-value products and provide a strong economic incentive to reduce these invasive species and lessen their detrimental environmental, ecological impacts on the great lakes and Mississippi River systems.
